Deskal Maths Trainer - GitHub Pages + Thunkable upload instructions

1) Unzip this package.
2) Create a GitHub repository (or use an existing one). Upload these files to the repo root:
   - index.html
   - script.js
   - style.css
   - about.html
   - icon.png
3) Enable GitHub Pages:
   - In the repo, go to Settings → Pages (or "Pages" tab).
   - Under "Source", choose branch: main (or master) and folder: / (root).
   - Save. GitHub will provide a URL like: https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/
4) Open the URL with /index.html at the end to confirm the quiz loads.
5) In Thunkable:
   - Create or open a project.
   - Add a Web Viewer component to the screen.
   - Set its URL property to your GitHub Pages URL (e.g. https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/index.html)
   - Test using Thunkable Live or Download → Android (APK).
6) To publish on Google Play:
   - Export from Thunkable as an APK or AAB and follow Play Console upload steps.

If you want, I can upload the files to a GitHub repo for you and give you the Pages URL — tell me your GitHub username and I will prepare it.
